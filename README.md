# UR_FlyWheel_InvertedPendulum

The flywheel inverted pendulum represents an underactuated mechanical system including a nonlinear model but allowing a linear approximation around the unstable equilibrium point in the upper position.

The porpuse of this repository is propose control schemas designed by  Manuel Olivares and Pedro Albertos in "Linear control of the flywheel inverted pendulum" [1], are presented some possible implementations in matlab/simulink, realized for a project in Underactuated Robotics course during my M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Sapienza, Rome.
