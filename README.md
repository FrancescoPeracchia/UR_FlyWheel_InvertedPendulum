# UR_FlyWheel_InvertedPendulum

The flywheel inverted pendulum represents an underactuated mechanical system including a nonlinear model but allowing a linear approximation around the unstable equilibrium point in the upper position.

Here are presented some possible control schema design by  Manuel Olivares y Pedro Albertos in "Linear control of the flywheel inverted pendulum" [1] , a possible implementation in matlab/simulink realized for a project in a Underactuated Robot course during my M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics by me,Kevin Munda and Marco Vannoli.
